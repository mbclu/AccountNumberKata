This program takes a file of account numbers represented as ' ', '_' and '|' characters
and prints them out as account numbers.

There is a some basic error checking including whether or not the files exists
and if the account numbers are formatted correctly. Additionally, the account numbers
will be reported as "ERR" if they do not have a valid checksum and "ILL" if 1 or more
of the account numbers is illegible.
	
To run the RELEASE program (Parser.exe), open a command shell in and call the program from the command line.
Command line usage is as follows:
Valid arguments are a single input file name OR
an input file name accompanied by an output file name.

If only the input file name is given, the output will be written to the standard output.
If an output file is also specified, the account numbers will be written to the file.

To run the DEBUG program (ParserTest.exe), which runs all tests using the gtest framework
make sure that the test_files folder is in the same directory as the executable and simply
run ParserTest.exe from the command line.
